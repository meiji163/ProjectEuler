The number of increasing numbers with exactly _n_ digits is the binomial coefficient _C(n+8,8)_. To see this, note that increasing numbers with _n_ digits are in bijection with paths of length _n+8_ on a _(n+1) x 9_ grid that

 1. Only goes right or down and
 2. Begins in the upper left corner and ends in the lower right corner.

For example the increasing number 136 corresponds to the path 

|| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4| 5 | 6 | 7 | 8| 9
|--|-- |-- |-- |--|-- |--|--|--|--|
 |**1**| x| |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|**2**| x | x | x |  |
|**3**|  |    | x | x | x | x | 
| **4**|  | 	|   |   |   | x | x | x |x

Each path is uniquely determined by choosing 8 places for the path to go right, so there are _n+8_ choose _8_ of them.

The number of increasing non-negative integers with at most _n_ digits is therefore 

<math> C(8,8) + C(9,8) + ... + C(n+8,8) = C(n+9,9)</math>

by the [Hockey Stick identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey-stick_identity). A similar argument shows that the number of decreasing numbers is C(n+10,10).  Taking into account overlap and discarding 0, the total number of non-bouncy numbers with at most _n_ digits is 

<math>C(n+9,9) + C(n+10,10) - 10n - 2.<math>
