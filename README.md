# ProjectEuler
Solutions for selected Project Euler problems. **Do not read if you want to solve the problem yourself first (obviously)**. I aim to give relatively complete mathematical proof when warranted. IMHO, "This just happens to give me the right answer" or "I blackboxed a bunch of math I don't understand" **is not a solution**. 

Problem_**n**.md explains the solution to problem **n** and p**n**.py or p**n**.cpp contains the code.
