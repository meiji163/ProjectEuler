# Project Euler
Solutions for selected Project Euler problems.

**IMPORTANT: Do not read if you want to solve the problem yourself first**. 

My rules for solutions are: 
* No "blackboxing" math (or at least give references)
* Only use standard libraries
* Program must finish in < 60s

If mathematical details are needed, the explanation for problem **n** is in Problem_**n**.md.
