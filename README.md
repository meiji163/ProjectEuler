# ProjectEuler
Solutions for selected Project Euler problems. **Do not read if you want to solve the problem yourself first (obviously)**. 
My rules for solutions are: 
* No "blackboxing" math
* Only use standard libraries
* Program must finish in < 60s (Project Euler rule)

If mathematical details are needed, the explanation for problem **n** is in Problem_**n**.md.
